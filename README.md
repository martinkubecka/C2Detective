$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: To learn more about different Scapy v2.x bundles visit https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

### :old_key: API Keys

- enrichment engine uses the following APIs:
  - [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)
  - [AlienVault](https://otx.alienvault.com/)
  - [CIRCL's BGP Ranking](https://www.circl.lu/projects/bgpranking/)

> *currently working on detection features*

### :clipboard: To-Do

- following categories contains features that are in a queue for implementation
- this list is ***not exhaustive*** and additional features will be added during development

#### General

- implement cashing (e.g. database) for enriched data and IOCs

#### Packet Capture Analysis

- [ ] extract domains from HTTPs X509 certificates

#### Data Enrichment & Correlation 

- [ ] add Feodo Tracker : sharing botnet C&C servers - lists generated every 5 minutes (https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/blocklist/)
- [ ] add SSL Blacklist (SSLBL) : identifying and blacklisting SSL certificates used by botnet C&C servers (https://sslbl.abuse.ch/)
- [ ] add Botvrij.eu : provides different sets of open source IOCs (https://www.botvrij.eu/ ; https://www.botvrij.eu/data/)
- [ ] add Binary Defense Systems Artillery Threat Intelligence Feed and Banlist Feed (https://www.binarydefense.com/banlist.txt)
- [ ] add C&C Tracker : active and non-sinkholed C&C IP addresses (https://osint.bambenekconsulting.com/feeds/c2-ipmasterlist.txt)

#### Detection

## :toolbox: Development

- contributions to this project are currently not allowed

### :office: Virtual Environment

1. use your package manager to install `python-pip` if it is not present on your system
2. install `virtualenv`
3. verify installation by checking the `virtualenv` version
4. inside the project directory (`C2Detective`) create a virtual environment called `venv`
5. activate it by using the `source` command
6. you can deactivate the virtual environment from the parent folder of `venv` directory with the `deactivate` command

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv --version
$ cd C2Detective/
[C2Detective]$ virtualenv --python=python3 venv
[C2Detective]$ source venv/bin/activate
[C2Detective]$ deactivate
```

  -q, --quiet                    do not print banner
  -n NAME, --name NAME           analysis keyword (e.g. Trickbot, Mirai, Zeus, ...)
  -c FILE, --config FILE         config file (default: 'config/config.yml')
  -s, --statistics               print packet capture statistics
  -r, --report-iocs              write extracted IOCs to JSON file
  -e, --enrich                   enable data enrichment
  -o PATH, --output PATH         output directory file path for report files (default: 'reports/')

> *currently working on detection features*

### :clipboard: To-Do

- following categories contains features that are in a queue for implementation
- this list is ***not exhaustive*** and additional features will be added during development

#### General

- implement cashing (e.g. database) for enriched data and IOCs

#### Packet Capture Analysis

- *no queued tasks at this moment*

#### Data Enrichment & Correlation 

- [ ] add [Feodo Tracker](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/blocklist/) : sharing botnet C&C servers - lists generated every 5 minutes
- [ ] add [SSL Blacklist](https://sslbl.abuse.ch/) : identifying and blacklisting SSL certificates used by botnet C&C servers
- [ ] add [Botvrij.eu](https://www.botvrij.eu/) : provides different sets of open source IOCs
- [ ] add [Binary Defense](https://www.binarydefense.com/banlist.txt) Systems Artillery Threat Intelligence Feed and Banlist Feed 
- [ ] add [C&C Tracker](https://osint.bambenekconsulting.com/feeds/c2-ipmasterlist.txt) : active and non-sinkholed C&C IP addresses

#### Detection

- [ ] detect unusual big HTML response size

## :toolbox: Development

- contributions to this project are currently not allowed

### :office: Virtual Environment

1. use your package manager to install `python-pip` if it is not present on your system
2. install `virtualenv`
3. verify installation by checking the `virtualenv` version
4. inside the project directory (`C2Detective`) create a virtual environment called `venv`
5. activate it by using the `source` command
6. you can deactivate the virtual environment from the parent folder of `venv` directory with the `deactivate` command

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv --version
$ cd C2Detective/
[C2Detective]$ virtualenv --python=python3 venv
[C2Detective]$ source venv/bin/activate
[C2Detective]$ deactivate
```
